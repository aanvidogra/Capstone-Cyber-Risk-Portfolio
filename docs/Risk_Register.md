# Initial Risk Register

Likelihood and impact are scored from 1 (low) to 5 (high).

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

| Risk ID | Threat | Vulnerability | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Business Impact |
|--------|--------|---------------|------------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| R1 | Phishing attack | Employees may click malicious emails or enter credentials into fake login pages | 4 | 5 | 20 | Unauthorized access to company email, files, and internal systems |
| R2 | Ransomware infection | Endpoints are not fully hardened or patched, allowing malware execution | 3 | 5 | 15 | Operational downtime, possible data loss, and recovery costs |
| R3 | Third-party vendor outage | Heavy dependence on the payment processor with limited redundancy | 3 | 4 | 12 | Inability to process transactions and possible revenue disruption |
| R4 | Cloud misconfiguration | Improper access settings in cloud storage or applications | 3 | 5 | 15 | Exposure of sensitive billing and financial data |
| R5 | Excessive user privileges | Users retain more access than needed for their job roles | 4 | 4 | 16 | Unauthorized data access, insider misuse, and audit concerns |
| R6 | Backup failure | Backups are not regularly tested for successful restoration | 2 | 5 | 10 | Delayed recovery and extended downtime after an incident |
| R7 | Unpatched vulnerability | Delays in patching internet-facing or internal systems | 3 | 5 | 15 | Exploitation of software weaknesses and service disruption |
| R8 | Monitoring gaps | Logs and alerts are incomplete or not reviewed consistently | 3 | 4 | 12 | Delayed detection and slower incident response |

## Highest Priority Risks

The highest priority risks in this assessment are:

- **R1: Phishing attack**
- **R5: Excessive user privileges**
- **R2, R4, and R7: High-impact technical compromise risks**

## Initial Risk Observations

The risk register shows that identity-related threats and access control weaknesses create the highest overall business risk. Phishing remains highly likely because it targets employees directly and can lead to account compromise. Excessive privileges also increase risk because users may retain access beyond what is necessary, making unauthorized access or misuse more damaging.

Technical risks such as ransomware, cloud misconfiguration, and unpatched vulnerabilities also score high because they could interrupt business operations or expose sensitive data. Even medium-ranked risks such as vendor outages, backup failure, and monitoring gaps remain important because they can worsen the effects of a larger incident.
